# Libft

First project of school 42. This exercise allows to consolidate the knowledge of the C pool. Indeed, it is a question of recoding a certain number of functions of the standard C library as well as other functions which can be useful thereafter.

**Part 1 - libc functions**

In the first part, I recoded a set of libc functions, as defined in their manual.

**Part 2 - Additional functions**

In the second part, I coded a set of functions that are not included in the libc, or that are included in a different form. Some of these functions can be useful to write the functions of part 1.
